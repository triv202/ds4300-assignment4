Comparing the two blocks of code we can see they accomplish the same thing by:

1) We are facilitating all looping from the first example by the use of map:
    - We start by reading the lines calling map - this is the first for loop
    - Then we split each line by comma value the same way in each
    - We loop on these split values using map again - this is the second for loop

2) In the first example we are rolling up the null counts by dynamically storing / updating
the null counts for each column.
    - The second does this differently by first creating an array for each line
        that stores either one or zero for each column if it is null.
    - Then it merges the lines arrays together by zipping
    - Finally it sums the values using reduce and map  the final null count.providing
